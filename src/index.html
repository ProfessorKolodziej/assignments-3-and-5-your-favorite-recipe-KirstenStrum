		<h2>The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
		<p>Alright. Take a deep breath. We're about to get into what I would equate to my life's thesis: the best
			chocolate
			chip cookie recipe ever. This recipe is literally 10 years in the making. They're soft, chewy, crunchy on the
			edges, perfectly salty-sweet, loaded with juuuust the right amount of chocolate. And when you create something
			that perfect, it would be a true crime to not share it with the world.</p>
		<p>So without further adieu, I present the best chocolate chip cookie recipe you'll ever make.</p>

	<section class="ingredients-section1">
		<h2>Ingredients for perfect chocolate chip cookies.</h2>
		<p>You're only as good as your ingredients. We recommend you splurge for all of the ingredients below to ensure
			you
			get a gourmet chocolate chip cookie.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unsalted Butter: Using unsalted butter means that you can fully control the amount of salt going into your
				cookies and also ensures that it browns evenly. You'll brown the butter for a nutty, toasty deep flavor as
				the
				base for your cookies!</li>
			<li>Light Brown Sugar: I like to make chocolate chip cookies with a combination of light brown sugar and
				granulated sugar. The light brown sugar will keep your cookies soft and chewy and give them that delicious
				brown sugar-y taste.</li>
			<li>Granulated Sugar: A little granulated sugar will give your cookie the perfect amount of crunch on the
				edges.
				You get the best of both worlds.</li>
			<li>Eggs: Eggs will bind your cookies together. A single egg and one egg yolk will gives these cookies their
				soft,
				chewy, not too cakey texture.</li>
			<li>Vanilla Extract: Vanilla is so essential to chocolate chip cookies. I know it might seem unimportant
				because
				you use a small amount of it, but it will take your cookies to the next level. I highly recommend using a
				100%
				pure vanilla extract if your budget allows. ALDI has a super affordable one, or if you're down to splurge I
				love Rodelle!</li>
			<li>Flour: All purpose flour is our flour of choice for these chewy cookies. It creates a tender but hearty
				crumb.
				Make sure when you are measuring your flour you measure it carefully using a spoon to aerate the flour. We
				recommend adding the first cup in and then adding the remaining 3/4 cup a little at a time to make sure
				you're
				not adding too much flour! Browned butter evaporates as it browns, meaning that the amount of butter can
				vary
				depending on how long you browned it for which can lead to less liquid in your cookie dough. See the
				directions
				for more guidance on this!</li>
			<li>Baking Soda: A little baking soda will give your cookies the perfect rise and crackle on top. Be sure
				you're
				using baking soda (not baking powder)! I'm lazy so I don't stir the dry ingredients together in a separate
				bowl, but I like to add the flour and then the salt and baking soda on top before folding so that the baking
				soda and salt get incorporated properly!</li>
			<li>Chocolate: When it comes to chocolate chip cookies, your chocolate can make or break your cookie. Splurge
				on
				a
				high quality semi sweet or dark chocolate. Milk chocolate is child's play. So are the store brand chocolate
				chips. Go for a good bar, chocolate disks, or high quality chocolate chunks. Whatever you choose, use 1 1/2
				to
				2 cups of it (depending on how chocolatey you like your cookies) and load up your cookie dough for big,
				melty
				pools of chocolate throughout your cookie.</li>
			<li>Salt: Baked goods NEED salt. Without it they're just cloyingly sweet. Salt adds that perfectly nuanced
				salty-sweet flavor that pushes a baked good from good to great.</li>
		</ul>

	<section class="brown-butter-section">
		<h2>How to make brown butter:</h2>
		<p>If you haven't had brown butter yet, you MUST try it. Browning your butter gives it an amazing complexity that
			enhances so many recipes.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Start by melting your butter over medium heat in a small sauce pan.</li>
			<li>Whisk the butter constantly as it melts to ensure it's evenly heated. As it melts the butter will start to
				foam. This is the sweet point between boiling the butter (NOT what you want) and not hot enough.</li>
			<li>Keep a close eye on the butter. I mean it-DO NOT WALK AWAY. As it transitions from its usual yellow color
				to
				a deeper golden hue and at last to a beautiful light golden brown. You'll know it's done by the smell: a
				nutty, caramelized aroma that is absolutely heavenly.</li>

		<h2>The Three Don'ts of Chocolate Chip Cookie Baking</h2>
		<p>These chocolate chip cookies have been tested thousands of times (I wish this were an exaggeration), so you can
			trust that I have all the tricks for you. Start taking notes!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't you dare forget the salt and the vanilla: These two ingredients make or break a cookie. Get the good
				vanilla and the flaky sea salt. I promise it will be worth it.</li>
			<li>Don't over mix: Repeat after me, ‚Äúovermixing ruins everything.‚Äù I know it can be fun to whisk away and
				overwork your dough as an excuse to eat more cookie dough, but do not do it.mYou will get dry, tough, sad
				cookies if you overwork the dough, so once you stir in the flour only mix until no streaks of flour remain!
			</li>
			<li>Don't over bake: In fact, when in doubt UNDER bake. The cookies will continue to bake as they cool. Plus,
				no
				one ever complained about a gooey center üôÇ</li>
		</ul>

	<section class="chill-section">
		<h2>Do you need to chill your chocolate chip cookie dough balls before baking?</h2>
		<p>Yes. But also no. Okay, let me explain.We highly recommend chilling your dough for at least 30 minutes. Giving
			the dough time to rest will allow the flour to absorb and the flavors to really settle in. This will create a
			super
			soft gooey center, while still preserving those crackly edges. If you bake your cookies off right away you'll
			get a less complex flavor, the cookies will spread a more, and the tops will be a little more craggy. They will
			still be delicious, but I promise they will be so much tastier if you give them a few hours in the fridge. My
			preferred sweet chill is at least 2 hours, but I often chill these overnight and bake off the batch the next
			day!</p>
		<p>To make scooping the cookies easier, I like to chill the dough for 30 minutes to let it firm up a little and
			then
			use a cookie scoop (or tablespoon if you don't have one!) to scoop the dough out into balls. You can then place
			the balls in an airtight container or covered tightly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper until ready
			to bake.</p>

	<section class="freeze-section">
		<h2>Can you freeze these cookies?</h2>
		<p>Heck yeah you can! You can either freeze your cooked cookies or the cookie dough balls (my personal fav).
			Here's
			how to do it:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Freeze the cookie dough. This is my favorite way to freeze these cookies, because then you can get ooey
				gooey, warm cookies whenever you want. Prepare the recipe as directed and then place the cookie dough balls
				in the
				freezer in a freezer safe plastic bag. When you're ready to bake your cookies (or single cookie!), remove
				the ball from the freezer and allow it to come to room temperature (about 30ish minutes). Then bake
				according to
				directions!</li>
			<li>Freeze the baked cookies. This is also an excellent way to prep ahead of time! Bake your cookies as
				directed
				and then allow them to cool COMPLETELY (this is so important, otherwise you'll get funky ice crystals on
				your frozen cookies). Place the cookies in a freezer safe plastic bag in a single layer and freeze for up to
				3
				months. When you're freezing the made cookies it's also important to under bake them so they stay nice and
				soft!</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I mean, c'mon. LOOK AT THAT GOOEY, MELTY COOKIE. Have you ever seen a more beautiful sight? I think not.</p>

		<h2>How to Store Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
		<h3>Can you make chocolate chip cookies ahead? How to freeze these best chocolate chip cookies? All your questions
			answered below!</h3>
		<p>These chewy chocolate chip cookies are best freshly baked. These are not the cookies I would recommend sending
			in
			the mail to a friend, or baking a few days before the party you're bringing them to. They will last in a sealed
			container for 3 days, but definitely start tasting a little stale after day 2.</p>
		<p>Our advice? If you want to prep ahead, make the dough in advance and scoop out balls of cookie dough. Place the
			cookie dough in a freezer plastic bag and freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months for whenever you want
			fresh
			baked cookies!</p>
		<p>You can also freeze the baked cookies in a freezer bag for up to 3 months so you can whip out a bag of homemade
			cookies any time without having to light the oven! If freezing, bake the cookies as directed and let them cool
			completely on your cooling rack before freezing!</p>

				Cook Time: 11 minutes
				Total Time: 26 minutes
				Yield: 15 cookies</p>
		</section>

		<section class="ingredients2-section">
			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>3/4 cup (168 g) unsalted butter*</li>
				<li>1 cup (200 g) brown sugar, packed</li>
				<li>1/4 (50 g) cup granulated sugar</li>
				<li>1 egg + 1 egg yolk, room temperature</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
				<li>1 3/4 cup (220 g) all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
				<li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt + more flaky seat salt for sprinkling</li>
				<li>1 1/2 cups semi sweet chocolate (225 g), chopped</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="instructions-section">
			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Brown the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly until the butter begins to foam and turns a
					golden
					brown, emitting a nutty aroma. Make sure you only brown the butter lightly. When butter browns the liquid
					evaporates off which can dry out your dough. As soon as the butter starts to turn brown and smell nutty,
					take
					it off the heat to prevent any more liquid from escaping. Take butter off the heat and allow to cool.
				</li>
				<li>In a large mixing bowl combine the cooled brown butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Beat until mixed
					together. Add in the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
				<li>In separate bowl mix together the flour, salt and baking soda. Mix half the dry ingredients into the wet
					until
					everything comes together. Slowly add in the remaining flour a little bit at a time, stopping if the
					dough
					starts to get too dry.* Fold in the chocolate. Do not over mix.</li>
				<li>Refrigerate the cookie dough for at least a half hour, or overnight.</li>
				<li>When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350¬∞F and line a cookie sheet with parchment
					paper. Use a 1.5 or 2 ounce cookie scoop to scoop the cookie dough out into balls, placing them 2 inches
					apart
					on the prepared sheet. Bake for 11 minutes*, or until the edges are just golden brown and the centers
					have
					puffed up but are still gooey.</li>
				<li>Allow to cool before eating!</li>
			</ol>

		<section class="notes-section">
			<h3>Notes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If you want to be really precise about it, my butter is always at 140 grams after being browned. If you
					have
					less left over you can add milk until it reaches 140 grams!</li>
				<li>Browned butter can evaporate off at different levels, so sometimes you may be left with less liquid than
					others. For this reason, we recommend adding the flour in increments to make sure you're not adding too
					much
					and left with a dry dough.</li>
				<li>Every oven is different, so make sure you keep an eye on your cookies. We recommend taking them out
					right
					when
					they have puffed up and just turning golden brown on the edges. The cookies should still be raw in the
					middle.
					If you leave them in past this point they will not have that gooey center you're looking for.</li>
